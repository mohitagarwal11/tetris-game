Hello, so i made this game in few hours the day before my birthday as a vibe code session, seemed cool so i am uploading it here. works only for linux right now because windows input is really annoying in terminal based games.
Currently working on c++ and python to use better libraries and automation tech for my future projects. 
okay gotta study for my sem exams.
Thank you for checking my project.
